## Business Description

Most books and websites introducing the C++ language do not have, in a single place, a complete set of source code to illustrate different concepts. Sometimes, examples of source codes are to be found spread accross multiple different web pages, or worse, accross different chapters in books (sometimes with no way to quickly download them). Also, in many cases, the provided code is not complete. I.e., it is just an excerpt of code that cannot be compiled by itself.

In order to fill this perceived gap, we will create a repository a large number of source code. Each source code will illustrate a particular concept. For example, there will be a source code containing the ubiquitous "Hello World" example. Other source code will illustrate how to implement different types of for loops, another one will implement different if/else statements, etc. Each source code will be complete, i.e. it can be compiled without modifications using any standard C++ compiler. Moreover, each source code will follow closely C++ best coding practices, as detailed by Bjarne Stroustrup (creator of C++), and Herb Sutter (lead software archittect for C++ at Microsoft) in http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines. A README.md file will be included, containing a detailed explanation for each provided source code, as well as a link to it. In addition, each file will contain a descriptive enough name to allow students to download them all, and later browse them by name.
